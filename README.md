# Project 1 - *Scavenger Hunt*

Submitted by: **Aryan Lakhani**

**Photo Scavenger Hunt** is an app that provides a list of tasks for users to complete. Users are required to attach photos to show that they have completed the task. After attaching the photo to a task, the app retrieves the location metadata from the photo and displays where the photo was taken on a map. [TODO] 

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] App displays list of hard-coded tasks
- [x] When a task is tapped it navigates the user to a task detail view
- [x] When user adds photo to complete the tasks, it marks the task as complete
- [x] When adding photo of task, the location is added
- [x] User returns to home page (list of tasks) and the status of your task is updated to complete
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User can launch camera to snap a picture	

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Video Walkthrough

This is a simple Video Walkthrough on how the app works and also show the files in the project. In the end I showed the App Icon.

## Notes

A challenge I was having a hard time with was with the creating your own task section. It was a bit confusing for me on how to connect it along with the Segue part. I was getting to many errors and just removed that part from the project since it was just an additional feature.
